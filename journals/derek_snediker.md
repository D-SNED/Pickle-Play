- Introduction to new tools/tech (BeeKeeper, PostgresSQL)

### Accomplishments

- Plan conceived and outlined
- Got approval from instructors and SEIRs on wireframes and database schema
- No one cried -- everyone had a good time!

### Challenges

- Nothing significant in particular
- Having to troubleshoot docker and practice rebuilding containers.

### Plan for next week

- Get started!
- Work on migration tables and FastAPI endpoints

---

## Week 2

### Goals

- Figure out how to use new tech in this project (SQL, FastAPI, etc.)
- Finalize database decision and setup database (mongo or SQL)
- At least 1 table created with migrations completed OR mongo collection created
- 1 backend endpoint completed (authentication endpoints are a group grade, not individual grade) and in a satisfactory merge request
- Journal updated for the week (should be updated once a week) and in a satisfactory merge request (aka now)

### Accomplishments

- Set up SQL tables, successful
- Initial migration successful
- First backend endpoint successful

### Challenges

- Making sure the linter is happy!

### Plan for next week

## Week 3

## Date: 10/11/23

### Today I worked on:

Finished the create tournaments endpoint as well as the get all tournaments endpoint. Wasn't too bad. It's been slow making progress because of just how group work can be. Often times you need to step away from your work to help out. We also are getting a lot better at writing our issues and merge requests as well as making detailed notes for our reviewers accepting out MR's.

**AH-HA!üí°**
I figured out how to implement error handling on my own. Doesn't seem like something that was that hard in hindsight, but it was a bit of a pain looking through documentation. Ultimately the approach I took was very quick and easy to implement and came straight from the fastAPI documentation. Also generally getting a better grasp of fastAPI. I'm actually having fun and enjoying the process of building the backend. It's tough at times but it's getting better.

**üéâ Celebrations üéâ**
Today went relatively smoothly compared to other days. I think the team is getting some muscle memory down and I'm hoping we can wrap up our endpoints tomorrow and start tackling the front end soon.

### Bugs encountered üêõüêûüêú :

I keep getting an Incompatible Migrations error that will stop my fastAPI container. It's the bane of our groups existence as many of us have encountered this error. Seems like the only solution is nuking docker. Starting from zero and mounting, building and composing containers. I'll try and take a picture of the error when I encounter it.
